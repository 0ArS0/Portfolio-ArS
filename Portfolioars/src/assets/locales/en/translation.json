However, my programming journey began at FAETERJ college in 2022, where, in three months, I absorbed the fundamentals of programming logic. It was there that a friend recommended SERRATEC to me, where I participated in an intensive bootcamp, dedicating five intense months that represented around 90% of my knowledge in the area.",
